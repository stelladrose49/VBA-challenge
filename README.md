Module 2 Challenge - VBA Challenge

In this challenge, I used looping to go through one year of stock data to retrieve ticker symbol, volume of stocks, open and closed pricing.

Additionally, I created columns for each category. The yearly change column contains conditional formatting that puts the positive cell values in green and the negative cell values in red.

I used the data to create a separate section that shows the greatest percent increases and decreases and greatest total volume.

Upon checking, my VBA script ran successfully on all 3 worksheets with data.

Enjoy!
